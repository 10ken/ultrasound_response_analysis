## Overview
A Statistical Analysis of ultrasound results and bodily metrics to better understand the relationship between bodily metrics, stricture, and ibs.

ibs = irritable bowel syndrome

## Objective 

1. We want to see if there is a correlation with symptom prevalence and stricture severity 
     - if do not have stricture and no active inflammation and yes digestive issues then yes to ibs 

2. Determine if patient has IBS if the patient does not have stricture"



## Tasks
### Data Requirements
    - IBS requirements
          - needed for downstream work post stricture analysis
          
    - Stricture requirements 
          - needed for initial analysis, identify difference in patients with and without stricture
          
    - Inflammatory disease
          - needed for handling missing data analysis

### Business Requirements
    - review lab results to see if patients have any other active diseases. 
         - if patient has active diseases then cannot make any ibs inferences
         

## Pipelines Needed
     1. clean data to desired format
     2. add new cleaned data to parent dataset"
     3. more to come...


## Analysis Tasks
    - chi squres
    - anova 
    - t.tests
    - percents
